            <p>At the risk of sounding pretentious, I like to consider things as I move through a process. This was surprisingly salient in my role as a resident assistant at the University of Connecticut. Each month, we needed to design and build a board on a constructive theme for our community - and month after month, my community would point out that they didn't pay a whole lot of attention. At first, I resented this. After discussing it further, however, my residents pointed out that boards were traditionally just squares of information on the wall.<br><br>My fellow RAs and I rose to the challenge, and started constructing more elaborate boards. I went with Disney and then Cartoon Network as themes, using the characters and scenes from the networks to convey messages on topics ranging from bystander intervention and sexual assault prevention to back-to-school basics. As I delve deeper into design, I've realized that this was truly design work; like any tech company, I was responding to the needs of a community by building something engaging and relevant. Whether it's construction paper or code, designers need to flex their creative muscles to get people thinking about the right information at the right time. <br><br>And in case you were wondering, yes. The flowers on the Simba & Nala board were scented with cologne.</p>
