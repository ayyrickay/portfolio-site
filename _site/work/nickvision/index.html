      Nickelodeon wants to be where kids are. Along the way, however, it recognizes that the 'Nick kid' is changing, and wants to stay relevant to that demographic. What cool product could help contribute to that goal, and add value to the overall brand while maintaining a prosocial edge?

    In the span of about 8 weeks, I teamed up with four other Viacom Summer Associates. We went through an iterative, market-driven design process and came up with Nickvision, an augmented reality app for the Nickelodeon brand. I primarily worked on the user interface and user experience (product), which involved prototyping key screens and features for our pitch. I also designed the booklet linked above. Our team, Nick Kids on the Block, presented our work to a room of managers, directors, and executives from across Viacom (including the CFO!)

  <h2 class="contain-text horizontal-center text-center">Reflection</h2>
  <p class="contain-text horizontal-center text-center">
    Building Nickvision was a challenging process. As a team member, I needed to collaborate with really smart people with very different backgrounds - that was one of our greatest strengths, in retrospect, but we had to learn to speak each others' language. As a designer, however, I learned a lot about working within a brand while responding to important feedback from users, peers, and stakeholders. Perhaps most importantly, Nickvision was my first experience taking ownership of a product. In some ways, this was nerve-wracking - presenting to the CFO of a giant media corporation will do that to you - but it was also awesome to be trusted as an innovator so early in my career. Plus, whispers around the office suggest that people were pretty excited about the Nickvision idea!
