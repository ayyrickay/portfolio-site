title: "papertrail"
deliverable: 'style tiles & mock ups'
role: "visual design"
problem: "writing is hard. let us help."
methods: "style tiles, mood boards, "
artifacts: n/a
solution: "PaperTrail was a digital humanities project, where a partner and I took charge of the visual site design. We developed a series of mood boards on Pinterest, which led us to creating a few rudimentary color palettes. We went off and found some templates for style tiles, while also working on some general wireframes for the team. This project challenged me to work from nothing. We didn't have a formal timeline or a ton of outside pressure to move forward, so it took initiative and digging to find out what we should be doing and how we should be doing it."
