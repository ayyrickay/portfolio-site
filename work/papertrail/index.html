title: "papertrail"
deliverable: 'style tiles & mock ups'
role: "visual design"
problem: "writing is hard. let us help."
methods: "style tiles, mood boards, "
artifacts: n/a
solution: "PaperTrail was a digital humanities project, where a partner and I took charge of the visual site design. We developed a mood board in Pinterest, which led us to creating a few rudimentary color palettes. We then created a few style tiles, while also working on some general wireframes for the team. The project evolved more than I expected, and that was the big takeaway for me: a design will seldom be clear initially, and will almost never be static."
