title: "Chip In"
deliverable: '<a href="http://tinyurl.com/i213chipin" target="_blank">interactive prototype</a>'
role: "visual & ux design"
problem: "itâ€™s time-consuming and difficult to find and organize donation drives in small communities."
methods: "personas, wireframes, contextual inquiry, interviews, mscw"
artifacts: '<a href="/img/assets/chipin_process.pdf" target="_blank">process documents</a>'
solution: "Chip In was a collaboration between myself and four other students in a User Interface Design and Development course. This class reinforced some of the core concepts of HCI, but also dealt with a number of great UX methodologies. Our team went through the entire design process from research to prototyping, and ended up with a project that evolved a considerable amount over the course of the semester. Sure, this project taught me how to whip up personas, scenarios, and interactive paper prototypes - but more importantly, I think it taught me the importance of flexibility in the design process - oh, and good documentation!"
