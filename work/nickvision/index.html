title: "nickvision"
deliverable: 'process book & interactive prototype'
role: "graphic design & ux design"
problem: "what product can add value to the nickelodeon brand?"
methods: "conversation generation, whiteboarding, sketching, round table brainstorming"
artifacts: '<a href="/img/assets/nickvision-process.pdf" target="_blank">process book</a>, <a href="/img/assets/nickvision-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">slideshow deck (pdf, non-interactive)</a>'
solution: "In the span of about 8 weeks, we came up with Nickvision, an augmented reality pitch for the Nickelodeon brand. I primarily worked on the user interface and user experience (product); I also designed the booklet seen here. Our team, Nick Kids on the Block, presented our work to a room of managers, directors, and executives from across Viacom. It was a challenging process; as a team member, I needed to collaborate with really smart people who often saw things from a different perspective. As a designer, however, I needed to learn how to work within a brand while responding to important feedback from users, peers, and stakeholders."
