title: "Chip In"
deliverable: '<a href="http://tinyurl.com/i213chipin" target="_blank">interactive prototype</a>'
role: "visual & ux design"
problem: "nonprofits need things. let's make it easier for people to help."
methods: "personas, wireframes, contextual inquiry, interviews, mscw"
artifacts: '<a href="/img/assets/chipin_process.pdf" target="_blank">process documents</a>'
solution: "Chip In was a collaboration between myself and four other students at the I School. Our team went through the entire design process, from research to prototyping. Our project evolved significantly over the course of the semester as we learned more about nonprofits and faced the daunting information architecture of a donations database. Sure, this project taught me how to whip up personas, scenarios, and interactive paper prototypes, but it also challenged me to stay flexible, and stay passionate even when the project throws curveballs your way."
