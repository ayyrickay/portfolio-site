title: "note"
deliverable: 'high-fidelity prototype'
role: "visual design"
problem: "how can we make the process of viewing notes a more visually engaging experience?"
methods: "aesthetic research, compositional studies, sketching, wireframing, prototyping"
artifacts: '<a href="/img/assets/note_project.pdf" target="_blank">process document</a>'
solution: "The process of reviewing notes is often a very text-heavy endeavor. For the most part, this works, but it neglects an entire aspect of vision - the ability to perceive form and color through images, and not just text. As a result, people are constantly using text as a primary searching tool.
This project re-imagines the process of reviewing notes, and puts photos at the front and center of the search experience. Primarily serving as an exercise in interface aesthetics, this project challenged me to think about interfaces that can accommodate varying data, and it was one of the first times I cast aside usability entirely and focused entirely on aesthetics."
