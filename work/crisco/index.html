title: "Crisco"
deliverable: '<a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~ricky.holtz/server/crisco" target="_blank">url shortener website</a>'
role: "front-end developer"
problem: "how the heck does a url shortener work?"
methods: "web development: flask, sqlite, bootstrap"
artifacts: '<a href="/img/assets/Crisco_TechnicalReport.pdf" target="_blank">technical report</a>'
solution: "Crisco focused more on technical aspects than aesthetics. My classmate and I started out developing the framework for a URL shortener using python's flask library, and then added on a number of technical features to improve the UX. This included a random URL generator (rather than requiring a tag), a dupe-free tag database that generated a unique 'random' URL for a given link, and mobile responsiveness. We also tried to keep the project lighthearted, and went with the southern theme and a fun 404 page. Overall, though, get it? Crisco, like the shortening? And it shortens URLs?"
