problem: "A url shortener is pretty straightforward when you're using it - but building it is another issue entirely. For this project, my friend and I wanted to explore servers, databases, and front-end web development... And we wanted to have a bit of fun with it."

reflection: "My front-end development skills and graphic design sensibilites have grown significantly since I finished this project. Still, it taught me all about the web stack, and although I'm typically spinning up servers in Node.js rather than Python these days, the fundamentals all happened in this project. Perhaps most importantly, this project really developed my love of front-end development - I just needed a chance to dive in."

Crisco focused more on technical aspects than aesthetics. My classmate and I built a simple server which received POST requests from user input and fetched appropriate pages using Python's Flask library. It stored inputs in a simple binary database. Once we had an MVP, we added a couple of features, including a random URL generator (rather than requiring a tag), and a dupe-free tag system that generated or fetched a unique random URL for a given link. We upgraded our database to a more robust and secure SQLite tool, and made the site responsive. We also tried to keep the project lighthearted, and went with the southern theme and a 404 page that we found pretty delightful.
