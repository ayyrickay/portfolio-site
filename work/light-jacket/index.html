problem: "I'm a native San Diegan, and a New Englander by virtue of my four years in Connecticut. So, whether it's a scorching day in the SoCal sun or furious blizzards and torrential downpours on the East Coast, I liked to think that I was okay in any weather - and then, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. In my hubris, I ventured to the city without a jacket in the summer months, and I was freezing for the whole day. Obviously, this story isn't uncommon - and there's tons of historical weather data available that clearly shows San Francisco's unusually cold summers and warm autumn. So, I decided to make an infographic that could present weather data - which is traditionally pretty dull - into something fun."

process-txt3: "flattening the silhouette in illustrator. The image becomes chunky and takes on new character, while also feeling aesthetically cohesive"
reflection: "In writing, conversation, and life in general, I sometimes have this reflex where I think that, in order to prove something, I need to find a barrage of facts for people. In reality, though, a little bit of data presented in the right way can have a much more powerful effect on people. This infographic doesn't actually have a lot of information, but it says a lot about San Francisco on a qualitative and quantitative level; people can see weather patterns and better understand the seasonality of the city. Beyond that, they can see something about the fashion, which is hinting towards trendy, and they also see a famous quote with proper attribution. Without explicitly saying anything, the infographic helps people get 'in on the joke' about the weather in the Bay. That being said, I think that this infographic still needs some work; I don't think the sportier side of the bay has been captured, so a windbreaker silhouette would be a nice nod to SF's incredible hiking opportunities, as well as its casual nature. Furthermore, I think that seeing historic highs and lows could really contextualize the average, showing people just how wild the weather can be, despite us being in California."

Initially, I really struggled to decide a way to make weather data interesting. It's easy to try and put a ton of information onto a page to try and tell a story. But then, I realized: a narrative infographic needs to offer people a poignant question or a meaningful solution. For people in the Bay, that solution is pretty easy: always, always carry a light jacket.

Using this, I divided my page into seasons, and tried to find appropriate clothing for each season. I didn't really know what I wanted to do, so I just started looking for inspiration, and pretty soon I noticed that a lot of jackets are really awesome. They're colorful, and serve as a pop of color for people's outfits. So, I dropped the images into photoshop, cut the people out, and then isolated their jackets and made the rest of their bodies a silhouette.

This effect felt like it was in the uncanny valley, though - the jackets looked hyperrealistic against the flat image of the person. I needed to abstract away, and so I ported my files over to Illustrator, and did a quick and dirty live trace. This turned each jacket into blobs of color while also establishing a more unified effect between the silhouette and the clothing. I drew up my data, and placed everything into InDesign so that I could print the document, and added some minor texture and graphic flair like lines to make the whole thing feel a little more holistic and visually engaging. Finally, I checked the quote for proper attribution - and no, contrary to popular belief, it wasn't Mark Twain!
