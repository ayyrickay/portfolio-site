This project re-imagines the process of reviewing notes, and puts photos at the front and center of the search experience. Primarily serving as an exercise in interface aesthetics, this project challenged me to think about interfaces that can accommodate varying data, and it was one of the first times I focused on aesthetics as a lens to usability rather than purely responding to user interviews.
