layout: page
title: "aesthetic notes"
deliverable: 'high-fidelity prototype'
role: "visual design"
problem: "clippings from the web often focus on text rather than image; in an increasingly visual culture, this seems like an oversight"
methods: "aesthetic research, compositional studies, sketching, wireframing, prototyping"
artifacts: '<a href="/img/assets/note_project.pdf" target="_blank">process document</a>'
page-header-alt: "bright rectangles with text and imagery"
page-header-image: "aesthetic-header"
action: This project re-imagines the process of reviewing notes, and puts photos at the front and center of the search experience. Primarily serving as an exercise in interface aesthetics, this project challenged me to think about interfaces that can accommodate varying data, and it was one of the first times I cast aside usability entirely and focused entirely on aesthetics."
