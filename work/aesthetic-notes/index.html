problem: "I recently got very interested in Evernote - in particular, the web clipping feature. I love saving all of my content, but I noticed that Evernote's interface relies heavily on the text of clipped articles. In an increasingly visual culture, I wanted to explore ways of reframing this information. Especially since I didn't have access to Evernote's user research, this was an exercise focusing on mobile design and aesthetics."

reflection: "This project was a stern reminder that graphic design is hard. I love working in the realm of composition, color, and hierarchy, but it's hard! I also found out how much I rely on user research; I basically couldn't validate my concept, and the usability of this system isn't rigorously considered. For me, this is a friendly reminder that usability and aesthetics go hand in hand."

I went through an interesting aesthetic design process. Rather than starting with user interviews, I went out into the world and explored reflective spaces like libraries or the shower, and used these to get inspiration for what this interface could look like. I created personas as a way to establish a workflow and key screens, and then did some competitive analysis. With all of that groundwork was done, I went to wireframes and worked my way up to high fidelity mock-ups using Sketch by Bohemian Coding.
