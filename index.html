      <h3>nickvision</h3>
      <p>nickelodeon wants to be where kids are, rather than just being in front of kids when they're staring at a screen. with a team of four other summer associates, we prototyped an augmented reality app and developed a business plan for the product. we presented our work in front of senior executives from across viacom, and got augmented reality into the nickelodeon 'sandbox' of ideas.</p>

      <h3>magazine web clippings</h3>
      <p>the aesthetic experiences that we find in tools like evernote rely heavily on text, despite an overall shift to a visual culture. through an aesthetic exploration of the evernote web clipper service, i developed an image-based concept for evernote. while it requires significant usability testing and interaction design, it received largely positive aesthetic reviews.</p>

      <h3>url shortener</h3>
      <p>your general url shortener will be a pretty boring affair, despite the fact that it's an incredibly useful tool. working with one other person, we developed a full-stack url shortener that had some fun little easter eggs for people.</p>
