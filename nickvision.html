infotext: "The Viacom Summer Associates Program was a nationally competetitive, 10-week long experience that pretty fundamentally changed my life. The media industry is changing so rapidly, and working in digital analytics exposed me to all parts of the company in a whirlwind of meetings, spreadsheets, and numbers - but the summer associates program had an additional challenge: to come up with the pitch for a game-changing project for a Viacom brand.<br><br>I was assigned to work on a project for Nickelodeon with a team of four of the nine other summer associates. In the span of about 8 weeks, we came up with Nickvision, an augmented reality pitch for the Nickelodeon brand. I primarily worked on the user interface and user experience (product); I also designed the booklet seen here.<br><br>Our team, Nick Kids on the Block, presented our work to a room of managers, directors, and executives from across Viacom. It was a challenging process; as a team member, I needed to collaborate with really smart people who often saw things from a different perspective. As a designer, however, I needed to learn how to work within a brand while responding to important feedback from users, peers, and stakeholders. I'm proud of the results."
