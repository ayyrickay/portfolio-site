infotext: "I first got interested in photography because of the idea of photovoice from anthropology. In the Fall of 2013 I got a DSLR, started fiddling with the settings, and have been taking photos ever since. I tend to approach my photos from an exploratory perspective; rather than trying to set up scenes, I'm more interested in going on a hike and trying to find out what exists in the world, and hopefully capture it from an interesting perspective.<br><br>Photography has taught me valuable lessons about design, primarily in the areas of composition, color, and presence. The eye of a photographer is always searching for a great scene, after all, and it doesn't just shut off. Now, when I sit down to build a prototype or design a flyer, I find that same eye working to try and generate the images that I would otherwise find out in the world."
