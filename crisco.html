infotext: "Crisco is a URL shortener, and we think it's pretty good at its job.<br><br>
My partner and I started off by using Flask, a web development microframework written in Python. We built a pretty simple URL shortener at first; it took a URL, validated a 'shortened tag' with Javascript on the front end. Then, things moved to the back end, where validation happened with Python and a simple database package called Shelve. It was a pretty rough prototype - but it worked, and set us up to build better functionality and features.<br><br>
We went ahead and added a more robust SQLite database that generates a data log, developed a randomized tag feature, and cleaned up the design of page - and along the way, made some cleaner, mobile-responsive HTML/CSS that strayed further from Bootstrap. And, just for fun, we really started to run with the Crisco name, adding in a bit of retro Southern charm to the site's copy and typography. Also, this project got me obsessed with custom 404 pages as an integral part of the user experience!"
