infotext:   The research process demands a clarity and elegance that I value and attempt to reflect in other aspects of my life. The process of distilling complex concepts and unintuitive phenomena into something actionable takes effort, an open mind, and some imagination, but the hard work of foundational research goes a long way in making something great – and along the way, I learn a little bit more about humanity and my relationship to the people around me. What’s not to love?<br><br>These projects help show the end results of a few specific projects. The first two (posters in color) were year-long projects, while the quantitative study lasted a semester. I helped design, execute, analyze, and present each one at presentations of varying formality. These posters also show my research presentation, which I like to argue has gotten better over time; I started to incorporate better color palettes, and relying on rules of typography to demonstrate relationships among text.
