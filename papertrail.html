infotext: "PaperTrail was a project for a graduate-level course in digital humanities. I worked alongside two other undergrads and three grad students, and we ultimately decided to make a writing guide without any certainty that we could pull it off. It was also my first attempt at user interface design and branding - and I'm actually quite proud of the project! Despite the issues in the interface, it taught me mountains and provided me with the pivotal the leap from articles and conversations about UX. That semester, I had to fire up Photoshop and Illustrator and make something.<br><br>On this page, you can see my organic color palettes, and then my first attempts at style tiles in later iterations, and below that the color-infused wireframes of the PaperTrail modules, and their photo-based updates. Surprisingly, I'm still a fan of the intro pages of a dark forest and minimal buttons. They fit the reduced compass, and also feel appropriate in a minimal splash screen kind of way - and they even have some copy about the design process still hanging around!"
