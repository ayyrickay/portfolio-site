infotext: "Animation taught me a lot of things, but the three main lessons were as follows: plan, check your progress, and get something done. The process of bringing a drawing to life involves a bit of planning - I had to create keyframes, decide what motion I needed in between those keyframes, and revise my plan as I actually sat down to draw - and of course, I had to make it happen within a deadline.<br><br>I had to work hard, often putting in two hours for every second of content. It tended to be worth it, though; seeing your drawings come to life is pretty much the best feeling ever.
